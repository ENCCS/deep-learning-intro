This lesson gives an introduction to Deep Learning for researchers who are familiar with the basics of (non-deep) Machine Learning. The lesson starts with explaining the basic concepts of neural networks, and then goes through the different steps of a Deep Learning workflow. Learners will learn how to prepare data for deep learning, how to implement a basic Deep Learning model in Python with Keras, how to monitor and troubleshoot the training process and how to implement different layer types such as convolutional layers.
