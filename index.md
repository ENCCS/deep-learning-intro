## Looking for Beta Testers!
**We are currently looking for volunteers to test this lesson!**
If you would like to teach this lesson in a pilot workshop,
please let the lesson developers know by
[opening a new issue on the lesson repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/deep-learning-intro/issues/new)
or posting to the [`#machine_learning` Slack channel](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CKLUYLY2F)
on [The Carpentries Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).
We would love to help you prepare to teach the lesson and
receive feedback on how it could be further improved,
based on your experience in the workshop.
