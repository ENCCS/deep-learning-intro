This page documents the design process and motivation of this lesson material.

## Target audience

The main audience of this carpentry lesson is PhD students that have little to no experience with deep learning.

### Pain points of target audience

Probably have overhyped expectations of deep learning. They don’t know if it’s the right tool for their situations. They have no idea what it takes to actually do deep learning.

Want to quickly have some useful skills for their own data.

## Required Pre-Knowledge

- **Basic Machine Learning Knowledge** – Data Cleaning, Train & Test Split, Overfitting & Underfitting, Metrics (Accuracy, Recall, etc.),
- **Python** – Previous Experience programming in python is required (Refer to Python Data Carpentry Lesson )
- **Pandas** – Knowledge of the Pandas python package

## Learning objectives

- **Prepare input data for use for deep learning** – This includes cleaning data, filling missing values, normalizing, and transforming categorical columns into dummy encoding.

- **Design and train a Deep Neural Network** – This includes knowledge of when to different types of layers

- **Troubleshoot the learning process** – Often when designing neural networks training will not automatically work very well. This requires setting the parameters of the training algorithm correctly, modifying the design of the network or changing the data pre-processing

- **Measure the performance of the network** – After training the performance of the network should be checked to prevent overfitting.

- **Visualizing Data and Results** – Within each episode how to visualize data and results

- **Re-use existing network architectures with and without pre-trained weights** – Re-use of architectures is common in deep learning. Especially when using pre-trained weights (transfer-learning) it can also be very powerful.
