## Setup before the lesson
The required python packages for this lesson often result in installation issues,
so it is advisable to organize a pre-workshop setup session where learners can show their installation and get help with problems.

Installations on learners' devices have the advantage of lowering the threshold to continue with the material beyond the workshop. Note though, that this lesson can also be taught on a cloud environment such as [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [My Binder](https://github.com/carpentries/scaffolds/blob/master/instructions/workshop-coordination.md#my-binder). This can serve as a backup environment if local installations fail. Some cloud environments offer the possibility to run the code on a GPU, which significantly increases the runtime of deep learning code.
