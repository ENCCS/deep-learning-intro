# StudyGroup@Uio

- Share your favorite coding skills and tools with your friends and colleagues in friendly, no-pressure work-alongs.
- Get together to work on your coding projects, help each other out and share your work.
- Meet new people in your field, organization or community - and find out what we can do when we work together.

We are meeting on Fridays from 14:00-16:00. Check our [event calendar](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/studyGroup/#portfolio).

# NIRD toolkit

When working with real data, you will be very quickly hit by the lack of computing power and storage. Using GPUs will then become useful.

If you are working in a University in Norway, you can inquire for [national computing resources and storage](https://www.sigma2.no/). These resources are managed at a national level by [Sigma-2](https://www.sigma2.no/). 

In addition, [Sigma-2](https://www.sigma2.no/) offers a number of additional services as part of the [NIRD toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/content/sigma2-launches-nird-service-platform), and in particular offers the possibility to deploy your own [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks or  [jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) online and linked to large storage. You can configure your jupyter instance to use GPUs.
