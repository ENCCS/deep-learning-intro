## What is Deep Learning?

*relation of DL to ML (infographics AI, ML, NN, DL)

some nice starting info here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/

> ## What is Deep Learning:
>
> Give multiple definitions of Deep Learning and discuss;
>
{: .discussion}

> ## What is DL - solution
>
> learning outcome -> it is vague, find your own
>
{: .solution}

*the neuron definition

## Building blocks of NN

*building blocks of a DL model: 
    *example case CNN
        *show how each layer may look
        *eg based on face features
        *we learn from many examples what and eye looks like and where it is located
*-> needs high amount of data

## Deep Learning workflow

(one way, open for discussion and to be filled with information)
1. formulate the problem

2. get data
where to get data from

3. prepare data
common steps for data preparation

4. choose model 
build from scratch vs reuse vs transfer learning

5. choose model parameters

6. train model

7. hyperparameter tuning

8. 'predict'

(1 and 2 sometimes mixed)

## Deep Learning in Python

* many different options
    * name them (and known limitations)

* why keras (and why 'with' tensor-flow)
    * easy start
    * huge community
        * help and tutorials online
    * 

> ## Keras 
>
> load keras and do something simple with it, get familiar with keras docs

> ## Computational resources
>
> some notes on computational resources needed for DL
> we try to have everyhting in the course run on a laptop with minimum requirements xxx
> some links where to get more resources to work with, eg HPC3Europe,AWS?,..?
