## Real-world application
To introduce the core concepts of deep learning we have used quite simple machine learning problems.
But how does what we learned so far apply to real-world applications?

To illustrate that what we learned is actually the basis of succesful applications in research,
we will have a look at an example from the field of cheminformatics.

We will have a look at [this notebook](https://github.com/matchms/ms2deepscore/blob/0.4.0/notebooks/MS2DeepScore_tutorial.ipynb).
It is part of the codebase for [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00558-4).

You do not need to fully understand the deep learning problem and the approach that is taken here, as it is quite domain-specific.
We just want you to appreciate that you already learned enough to be able to do this yourself in your own domain.

## Exercise: A real-world deep learning application in science

1. Looking at the 'Model training' section of the notebook, what do you recognize from what you learned in this lesson?
2. Can you identify the different steps of the deep learning workflow in this notebook?
3. (Optional): Try to understand the neural network architecture from the first figure of [the paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00558-4)

:::: solution
## Solution
1. The model summary for the Siamese model is more complex than what we have seen so far,
but it is basically a repetition of Dense, BatchNorm, and Dropout layers.
The syntax for training and evaluating the model is the same as what we learned in this lesson.
EarlyStopping as well as the Adam optimizer is used.
2. The different steps are not as clearly defined as in this lesson, but you should be able to identify '3: Data preparation',
'4: Choose a pretrained model or start building architecture from scratch', '5: Choose a loss function and optimizer', '6: Train the model',
'7: Make predictions' (which is called 'Model inference' in this notebook), and '10: Save model'.

## Extensive data preparation
You might have noticed that the data preparation for this example is much more extensive than what we have done so far
in this lesson. This is quite common for applied deep learning projects. It is said that 90% of the time in a
deep learning problem is spend on data preparation, and only 10% on modeling!
